# Topic 1 - HTML

## Description

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) **is not a programming language**; it is a *markup language* used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit.
It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.


This topic will be very important to start creating the base of UI programing.

## Exercises

After this presentation and reading of the HTML documentation, we are ready for fun. It's time to develop, are you ready?

> Is prefered a 'commit' point by point... That way is posible to see the progress and identify the problems easily.

### HTML Basics

#### Documentation

- [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)
- [HTML & CSS](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss.html)
- [HTML & Form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation)
- [HTML - Multimedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding)

1.A

- Change the header to **"My todo list"**.
- Add a list of **"todo items"** for your daily chores.

1.B

- Create another .html file. Create a table for your expenses.

1.C

- Create a "sign up" form with fields for: first name, last name, email, birthday, a dropdown to choose your favourite sport, and a text-area to include a small bio for the user. Add a button at the end to submit the form, and another one to clear the form. Add relevant validation rules for all fields (like required fields, valid email).
- Test your HTML files in at least Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Chrome for Android or iOS Safari.
