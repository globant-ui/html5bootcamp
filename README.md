→ [index](#index)

###Duration

Five weeks total.

Three weeks for guided learning and two weeks for app development.

→ [index](#index)

###Technical Assistance

You can contact other bootcamp participants or any available tutor if you need technical assistance. We will create one chat for boot camp members only, and another one for boot camp members and tutors when boot camp starts.

###Performance Measurement

1. Code review after each practice and sprint

2. Checkpoint completion after Learning stage with your assigned tutor

→ [index](#index)


###Handling Advanced Developers

Developers that move faster than average can go ahead and complete as much exercises as wanted.

→ [index](#index)

###Tools

1. At least, three different browsers installed on the developer machine. Example, Chrome, Firefox, and the Android browser using Android's emulator.

2. The IDE to use is [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

3. Skype Account + headset (audio calls)

4. Create your own[ GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this[ guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account.

5. Install your own NodeJS server
  * Download [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
  * Install `http-server` globally, by running `npm install -g http-server`
  * To start the server, from a command line interface, run `http-server` in the directory where you will clone the startup repo
  * Open your web browser and point to localhost:PORT (the `http-server` should have outputted the number of PORT you should use)

6. Fork this repo [https://github.com/globant-ui/startup](https://github.com/globant-ui/startup) to use as a base to host the project code.

→ [index](#index)



###General Guidelines

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1. The first three weeks will be used for intensive self learning. Each topic will have reading and practices parts. Tutors will be available to answer technical questions on a given chat room.

2. The next two weeks will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3. The project manager will coordinate learning days encouraging team communication in daily meetings.

4. The project manager will gather information regarding individual progress so we can look for alternative assistance where needed.

5. The project manager will lead the boot camp sprints as if it were a real project using SCRUM agile methodology.

6. Two boot camp chats will be created for feedback and technical assistance:

    1. Bootcamp HTML - ALL
Every person participating in the bootcamp is present here (students, tutors and PMs). Here is the place to ask for technical assistance!

    2. Bootcamp HTML - Assistants
Here you will reach just your boot camp fellows for asking question sharing knowledge.

7. Team play is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

8. Sprint duration will be 1 week.

9. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

10. All code and documentation must be in English.

11. Code must adhere to Globant’s UI [HTML](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide), [CSS](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide) coding guidelines.

###Proposed Test Applications

The test application will consist in a Last.fm client.

###Learning Days###

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for the next generation mobile apps; yeah, web apps! Web apps powered by the latest, and coolest toolkits, and techniques.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. ####Read:####
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

2. ####Practice:####
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention; if you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

3. ####Commit:####
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice.

### Introduction

At high level you could see the keys as:

![technologies logos](assets/html5-css-javascript.png "The platform")

HTML describes the content semantics and structure of a web page. It was designed as a markup language, if you know XML, you could consider HTML as a subset of XML with a predefined semantic.

On the other hand, CSS allows to define the look and feel of the content. It's used to set colors on HTML elements, customize sizes, define the layout of the document content, among others. (e.x. "The following list of elements must be shown as a menu", "The main title of the page should use this particular font").

JavaScript is a programming language that runs in all Web Browsers. Using JavaScript we can create full-fledge web applications.

Now that you know which are the three pilars of a web application's UI, it's time to dive into them.

####[Topic 0: HTML & CSS Basics](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-lab)

####Topic 1: JavaScript, and DOM APIs####

#####Reading:#####

1. Beginner: Eloquent JavaScript 2nd Edition [basic tutorial](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (in case you need it!)

2. Beginner to advance: [Speaking JavaScript: An In-Depth Guide for Programmers](http://speakingjs.com/)

3. Recommended: [devdocs.io](http://devdocs.io/) to check Web platform documentation around JavaScript, frameworks, Browser APIs, etc

#####Extra documentation:#####

* Web Platform Documentation Project: [http://www.webplatform.org/](http://www.webplatform.org/)

* MDN JavaScript Reference: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference)

* Understanding ECMAScript 6: [https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read)

* [ECMAScript® 2015 Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) *For really advanced developers*

* JSONP and CORS: [http://json-p.org/](http://json-p.org/) - [http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/)

* Using Chrome console to debug JavaScript [https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console)

#####Practice:#####

**Use latest IE, Chrome, or Firefox browser to develop. Try to use as much ECMAScript 6 syntax as you can. Favor ```let``` and ```const``` over ```var```**

1. Open your IDE, create a new file text, save it as index.html. Add the correct doctype, and a few tags with random content.

2. Add a stylesheet to the index.html. Use the stylesheet to center the text of all ```section``` elements of the page.

3. Add a hidden ```section``` with the following text inside: "Hello world".

4. When the page has finished loading the section must fade in. *Hint: Use JavaScript, Browser Events, and CSS3*

5. Add a button below the ```section``` to your index.html.

6. Attach a click event to the created button which calls a function that gets a response from [http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random](http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random). Write the response to the ```section``` element. *Hint: use the XMLHttpRequest to fetch data from the service*

7. From the previous exercise create a reusable function to perform AJAX calls. The function must accept a ```config``` object and return an ES6 Promise.

8. Show ```section``` content in red when a server error occurs.

9. Use the function created in exercise 6 to get the response from [https://api.github.com/search/repositories](https://api.github.com/search/repositories) with parameters data "q = 'JavaScript'". First log the service response in Chrome's console to analyze data (see provided link on Chrome console), then display repository's ```full_name``` as a list in the right side of the screen. The ```ul``` element must be used to list the repositories data.

10. Add an input type="text", and reuse the code for exercise 9, so the user can perform search for any repository.

11. Validate your page using W3C validator: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/)

12. Write a function that takes as input a matrix of data and outputs a DOM structure representing a table. Attach it to the body of a given page. *Hint: use ```document.createElement```, ```document.createTextNode```, and ```Node.appendChild``` methods*

#####Key Points:#####

4, 7, 10, 12

#####Mobile Test:#####

Test your code in a mobile device or in Android emulator.

Hint: A good option to test your code in a mobile device is to use Genimotion Android Emulator [http://www.genymotion.com/], which is one of the most fast and easy mobile emulators to install.

#####Commit:#####

Commit your practice code.

####Topic 2: Design Patterns and OOP in JavaScript####
In this Topic we will focus on learning how JavaScript approaches Object-Oriented programming. If you come from Java, or .NET you will find yourself a little bit lost at the beggining. ECMAScript6 provides a layer of syntactic sugar over the previous version(5.1) that is expected to simplify the language.

#####Reading:#####

1. Understand how *prototypes* works in ECMAScript 5.1 [http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/](http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/)

2. ECMAScript 6 New Features: [http://es6-features.org/](http://es6-features.org/). You can compare ECMAScript 5 and 6 code.

3. Read the Chapter on JavaScript classes from [*Understanding ECMAScript6*](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-classes) 

4. Read about [ES6 Modules](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-modules-in-depth)  

5. Extra: Read about AMD, CommonJS, and ES6 Modules [Writing Modular JavaScript](http://addyosmani.com/blog/writing-modular-javascript/) 

6. An overview on all the features ECMAScript provides [https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) 

#####Practice:#####

1. Create a Movie object:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Movie</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>- title <br />- year <br />- duration</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>+ play() <br />+ pause()<br />+ resume()<br /></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

2. Instantiate some of your favorite movies and play with them in the console.

3. Create an EventEmitter class with the following methods: ```on```, ```emit```, ```off```. The ```on``` method will allow to pass a callback or **listener** that will be executed each time a given event is triggered. The ```emit``` method will allow a class to trigger events to be consumed by other functions/objects. The ```off``` method will delete the listener.

4. Make Movie a subclass of EventEmitter. Publish "*play*" event on Movie.play(), "*pause*" event on Movie.pause(), and "*resume*" event on Movie.resume()

5. Create a Logger class with a ```log(info)``` method that will output ```info``` to the console. Make ```log``` listen to a Movie's 'play' event. You should be able to do something like this in the console:

    ```js
    let terminator = new Movie('Terminator', 1984, 90);
    let logger = new Logger();
    terminator.on('play', logger.log);
    // ...
    terminator.play(); // output: The 'play' event has been emitted
    ```

6. Create an object called Social with methods share(friendName) and like(friendName) that will generate the following output "{friendName} likes/share {Movie Name}". *Hint: declare Social as an object literal, use Object.assign to mix Social methods into a Movie instance. Use Template Literals to generate the like/share method output*. You should be able to do something like this in the console:

    ```js
    ironman.share('Mike Blossom'); // output: Share Iron Man with Mike Blossom
    ```

7. Create an Actor class and create some actors from one of your favorite movies.

8. Add a method to Movie that will allow to add one or more actors at the same time.
   ```js
   let terminator = new Movie('Terminator I', 1985, 60);
   let arnold = new Actor('Arnold Schwarzenegger', 50);
   let otherCast = [
     new Actor('Paul Winfield', 50),
     new Actor('Michael Biehn', 50),
     new Actor('Linda Hamilton', 50)
   ];

   terminator.addCast(arnold);
   terminator.addCast(otherCast); //Movie must contain an array of 4 actors
   ```
9. Using ES6 Modules split all your classes declarations into diferent files. Use Babel to create a single bundle. *Hint: check this [tutorial](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/)*

#####Practice:#####

1. Create the needed components to allow the user create a new Movie.

2. Create the needed components to show a list of your favorite Movies.

3. Create the needed components to allow the user edit a Movie.

4. Update the movie listing to allow the user delete movies.

5. Update the application to use ReactRouter and Flux.

**Tips:**
- First, try to think which should be your app structure (in terms of components).
- Second, figure out which component should handle the movies.
- You should create a component when trying to create a view (a view is also a component).
- To update the application with ReactRouter and Flux you may split out the add logic and the display logic into two views.
  Also you may provide the data storage (object) responsibility to Flux's storages.

You will apply all the knowledge obtained during the learning weeks.

You’ll be given with a backlog of user stories you will estimate with your PM.

Once estimated, user stories will be divided into sprints of one week.

You will participate on daily scrum meetings.
Will you be able to consult documentation? Of course! You will be able to use any resource you know that helps you complete your user stories, be it going back to documentation sites, tutorials or just googling what you need. Luckily the web is plenty of awesome resources waiting for you to grasp them!

####Commits####

You will commit your code to GitHub on a daily basis.

####Reviews####

Tutors will give you feedback at the end of each sprint by reviewing and commenting your committed code in GitHub. If possible tutors will give you even more frequent feedback, sometimes at the end of the day.
